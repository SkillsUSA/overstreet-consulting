            <h2>Who Am I:</h2>
            <p id="whoAmIText">My personal mission in life is to go and make disciples within the context of relationships and through the process of education. I am passionate about growing people helping them understand the importance of emotional intelligence and their strengths. I seek to grow people daily by asking Him to bring people into my path that I can make a difference. I aspire to please God’s purpose and plan in my life by helping others grow. I see myself helping faculty through developing their emotional intelligence and through developing their strengths, specifically Clinton’s Strengths Finder.

                I believe that W.B. Yeats stated a true philosophy of education best when he wrote: “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.” I seek to light a fire within
                
                those aspiring to change the world. E. G. White says that “True education means more than the pursuit of a certain course of study”. I believe that true teaching and learning in all avenues takes place in the context of relationship where the gateway of “head knowledge” begins by connecting at the heart of all those you come in contact with. I believe that an effective leader/educator should encourage and facilitate
                
                cooperation among all parties. Everyone that I come in contact with needs to see that I
                
                respect and honor their individuality as people, and learners in a cooperative and
                
                loving spirit. I am also reminded of what Mrs. White says about education, power, goodness intellectual knowledge and character: “True education does not ignore the value of scientific knowledge or literary acquirements; but above information it values power; above power, goodness; above intellectual acquirements, character”.

            <h2>Coaching Model:</h2>
            <p id="coachingModelText">
                Leadership has no “finish line.” We are all on a lifelong leadership journey, and every person’s journey is unique to them. Co-Active is a contextual lens to experience this journey from different orientations.

                As the pace of our lives has quickened, we have become increasingly action-oriented and results-driven. It seems expedient to dispense with all the “soft” stuff (being) and instead just push to “get the job done” (doing). Unfortunately, this leaves us feeling disconnected and desperate for meaning and belonging. We wind up with what we might call “the hamster wheel” experience of life, as we run around alone in circles, desperately trying to get things done, only to find ourselves right back where we started. This is why it is so important to begin with the “Co.” Action arising from this place of being and receptivity is whole and integrated, rather than disconnected and driven. In order for us to experience life as whole, action must be grounded in being, in our sense of connection to a larger wholeness.
                
                When the Co and the Active go together, the action of our life is nourishing and fulfilling.

                        <li class="coachingListItem">“Executive Coaching” Leaders who are committed to personal transformation and the stewardship of their organizations understand that having the right answer is simply not enough. We challenge leaders to confront their mental models, which are their routine ways of thinking and seeing. Leaders who can claim a successful coaching outcome are those who understand that it is not what they know that makes them successful but rather the pursuit of what they do not know. These leaders demonstrate a greater professional and personal effectiveness in all their business relationships and endeavors.</li>
